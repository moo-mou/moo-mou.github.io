    * what is the data model

Performance
    Is it happening?	Did the navigation start successfully? Has the server responded?
    Is it useful?	Has enough content rendered that I can actually engage with it?
    Is it usable?	Can I interact with the page, or is it still busy loading?
    Is it delightful?	Are the interactions smooth and natural, free of lag and jank?
